Introduction
Computer vision has advanced considerably but is still challenged in matching the precision of human perception.

Open Images is a collaborative release of ~9 million images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, and visual relationships. This uniquely large and diverse dataset is designed to spur state of the art advances in analyzing and understanding images.

This yearâ€™s Open Images V5 release enabled the second Open Images Challenge to include the following 3 tracks:

Visual Relationship Track
In this track of the Challenge, we are asked to detect pairs of objects and the relationships that connect them.

The training set contains 329 relationship triplets with 375k training samples. These include both human-object relationships (e.g. "woman playing guitar", "man holding microphone"), object-object relationships (e.g. "beer on table", "dog inside car"), and also considers object-attribute relationships (e.g."handbag is made of leather" and "bench is wooden").
